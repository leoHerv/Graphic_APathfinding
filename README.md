# Graphic A* Pathfinding
  
### Description :  
The goal of this program is to place blue squares and their goal is to move towards the red square.  
Of course they have to go around the obstacles, the brown squares.  
For this we use the A* algorithm which allows the blue squares to find the optimal path.  

And that's all the features.  
It's really not finished but as it will stay in my computer I prefer to put it here.  
  
### What I learned :  
I learned to integrate an algorithm into a bigger project but also that once a project is badly coded, it is more difficult to remove the errors.  
  
### Compilation :   
To compile the project you need to use a terminal and use :  
-> gcc src/*.c -o prog -I include -L lib -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -mwindows  

### Specifications :   
This was a side project after the Console A* Pathfinding project that I have done.  
It was made in C with the SDL library, on Windows with the CodeBlocks IDE.  
But I made it compile without the IDE, with a console only.  
Made in the middle of the year 2022.
